Version Control Policies

The main branch will always contain the stable production-ready code.

The development branch will serve as the integration branch for testing new features.

All new features and bug fixes must be developed in feature branches and merged via pull requests.

Each pull request must be reviewed by at least one team member before merging to main.

Merge conflicts must be resolved before pushing changes to the repository.
