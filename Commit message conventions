To maintain clarity and consistency in version control, all team members must follow a structured commit message format:

Feature: For adding new features

Update: For documentation updates/ code optimisation

Fix: For fixing bugs/errors

Format: For reformatting code/documents with no functionality changes

Test: For temporary testing of updates/ features
